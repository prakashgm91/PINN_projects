This Python script is the finished version of my PINN model for solving a basic PDE. It pulls together a bunch of different methods like automatic differentiation, adaptive sampling, EMA weighting, and gumbel top-k picking. 
I spent a lot of time on trial and error to get the hyperparameters dialed in. 
Right now, most of the residuals are under the limit, though there are still a few tricky spots I’m planning to fix in the next update.
